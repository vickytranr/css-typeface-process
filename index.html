                <h2>Inspiration</h2>
                <p>
                    My typeface was inspired by single-line weight and geometric fonts, such as Montserrat, Lato, and Quicksand. I also drew from Bauhaus design, which is how I envisioned incorporating colour into my typeface later on.
                </p>
                <p>In the beginning, my typeface would be a display font, and would be used in designs reminiscent of Swiss Typography, or of a similar aesthetic, and it would make use of its coloured aspects to push that style. At the end however, the purpose of the typeface shifted in a direction where it would more likely be used on more formal projects such as in corporate pieces, anything sleek and minimal.</p>

                <p>I wanted to create some minimalistic, but could still be a display typeface; at first I was less concerned about its readability, and through further iteration, my typeface's aesthetic slightly shifted.</p>

                <h2>Process</h2>
                <p>In designing the letterforms, I based many off of a circle, and built each element around that idea.</p>

                <p>
                    At first, yellow motifs would help to highlight and form the shape of each letterform, and in combination with a few limited single lines, they would create the letters.
                </p>

                 </figure>
                 <p>The yellow motifs ended up being too distracting, and I focused on forming the letters with just the singly weight lines. I also shifted the stems of the letters to make them cleaner.</p>

                 </figure>
                 <p>At this point, I re-incorporated the colour into the typeface to see how it could contribute to the form of the letters, and could be used in every glyph.

                  </figure>
                <p>However, I decided on only having the single line weight letters, and made them cleaner and minimalistic.</p>
